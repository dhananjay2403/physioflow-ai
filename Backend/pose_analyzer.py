# pose_analyzer.py
# -----------------------------
# This file contains logic for analyzing human pose and movement,
# likely using OpenCV or a pose estimation model (like Mediapipe).
# It is responsible for extracting keypoints from video frames
# and providing physiotherapy-related feedback based on posture or motion accuracy.
